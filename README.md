Welcome to the Design Patterns Repository!

This repository serves as a collection of my studies and implementations of various design patterns in software engineering. Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring design problems in software development. By studying and implementing these patterns, developers can enhance the quality, maintainability, and extensibility of their codebase.

## What are Design Patterns?

**Design patterns** are categorized solutions to common problems encountered during software development. They encapsulate best practices and design principles, enabling developers to create reusable and flexible software components. Understanding and applying design patterns can lead to more efficient, maintainable, and scalable codebases.

You canâ€™t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

## Classification

In the [Gang of Four Book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/), the authors featured 23 design patterns and classified them in three categories:

- [**Creational patterns**](/src/creational/) provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- [**Structural patterns**](/src/structural/) explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- [**Behavioral patterns**](/src/behavioral/) take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
