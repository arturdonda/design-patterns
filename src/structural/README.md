# Structural Design Patterns

The structural design patterns concern how objects are composed to form larger structures.

## List of Structural Design Patterns

The original GoF Structural design patterns are:

- **[Adapter](/src/structural/adapter/):** Converts the interface of a class into another interface expected by the clients. The Adapter allows certain classes to work together that would otherwise be impossible due to their incompatible interfaces.

- **[Bridge](/src/structural/bridge/):** Separates an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

- **[Composite](/src/structural/composite/):** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

- **[Decorator](/src/structural/decorator/):** Dynamically assigns additional responsibilities to an object. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

- **[Facade](/src/structural/facade/):** Provides a unified interface for a set of interfaces in a subsystem. The Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

- **[Flyweight](/src/structural/flyweight/):** Uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

- **[Proxy](/src/structural/proxy/):** Provides a representative (surrogate) or a placeholder for another object to control access to it.
