# Mediator (Behavioral)

The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly and allows them to communicate through a mediator object. This pattern centralizes communication between objects and reduces dependencies, making the system easier to understand and maintain.

## Intent

The intent of the Mediator pattern is to define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by centralizing communication between objects through a mediator object.

## Structure

The Mediator pattern typically involves the following components:

1. **Mediator**: This interface declares methods for communicating with colleague objects. It defines a common interface for communication between colleagues.

2. **Concrete Mediator**: Concrete Mediator classes implement the Mediator interface and coordinate communication between colleague objects. They maintain references to colleague objects and facilitate communication between them.

3. **Colleague**: This interface declares methods for interacting with other colleagues through a mediator object. It defines a common interface for colleague objects.

4. **Concrete Colleague**: Concrete Colleague classes implement the Colleague interface and communicate with other colleagues through a mediator object. They send and receive messages from the mediator to interact with other colleagues.

## Usage

The Mediator pattern is commonly used in scenarios where:

- A set of objects need to interact with each other without referring to each other explicitly.
- The system needs to support dynamic relationships between objects, where objects can be added or removed at runtime.
- There are complex communication patterns between objects that would be difficult to manage without a central coordination mechanism.

## Considerations

- **Centralized Communication**: The Mediator pattern centralizes communication between objects through a mediator object, reducing dependencies and promoting loose coupling.

- **Complexity**: Depending on the requirements, the Mediator pattern may introduce additional complexity, especially if there are many colleague objects or if the communication logic is complex.

- **Flexibility**: The Mediator pattern promotes flexibility by allowing dynamic relationships between objects and facilitating communication between them through a mediator object.

Overall, the Mediator pattern is a powerful tool for centralizing communication between objects and reducing dependencies in a system. It promotes loose coupling, flexibility, and maintainability by providing a central coordination mechanism for objects to interact with each other.
