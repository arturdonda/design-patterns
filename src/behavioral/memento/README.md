# Memento (Behavioral)

The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows the capture and externalization of an object's internal state without violating encapsulation. It enables the restoration of an object to a previous state, providing the ability to undo and redo operations. This pattern is commonly used to implement undo mechanisms in applications.

## Intent

The intent of the Memento pattern is to capture an object's internal state and externalize it, allowing the object to be restored to that state later. It provides the ability to undo and redo operations without exposing the object's internal structure.

## Structure

The Memento pattern typically involves the following components:

1. **Originator**: This class represents the object whose state needs to be saved and restored. It creates memento objects to capture its internal state and uses memento objects to restore its state.

2. **Memento**: This class represents the snapshot of the originator's internal state. It provides methods for retrieving and setting the originator's state.

3. **Caretaker**: This class is responsible for managing memento objects. It keeps track of multiple memento objects and provides methods for saving and restoring the originator's state.

## Usage

The Memento pattern is commonly used in scenarios where:

- The state of an object needs to be saved and restored, such as in undo mechanisms or checkpoints in applications.
- The state of an object cannot be directly exposed to other objects to maintain encapsulation.
- Multiple states of an object need to be stored and managed efficiently.

## Considerations

- **Encapsulation**: The Memento pattern preserves encapsulation by allowing the internal state of an object to be saved and restored without exposing its structure to external objects.

- **Resource Usage**: Depending on the requirements, the Memento pattern may require additional resources to store and manage multiple memento objects. Care should be taken to manage memory usage efficiently, especially in memory-constrained environments.

- **Complexity**: The Memento pattern may introduce additional complexity, especially when managing multiple memento objects and coordinating their usage with the originator object.

Overall, the Memento pattern is a useful tool for implementing undo mechanisms and managing the state of objects in applications. It provides a flexible and efficient way to capture and restore an object's internal state, promoting encapsulation and maintainability.
