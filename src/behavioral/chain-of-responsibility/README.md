# Chain of Responsibility (Behavioral)

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows multiple objects to handle a request without the client needing to know which object will handle it. It creates a chain of objects, each capable of either handling the request or passing it on to the next handler in the chain. This pattern decouples senders and receivers of a request and allows them to be added or removed dynamically.

## Intent

The intent of the Chain of Responsibility pattern is to decouple senders and receivers of a request by providing multiple objects that can handle the request. It allows the request to be handled by different objects dynamically at runtime.

## Structure

The Chain of Responsibility pattern typically involves the following components:

1. **Handler Interface**: This interface declares a method for handling requests. It may also include a reference to the next handler in the chain.

2. **Concrete Handlers**: Concrete Handler classes implement the Handler interface and handle requests that they are capable of handling. If a handler cannot handle a request, it forwards it to the next handler in the chain.

3. **Client**: The Client class creates and sends requests to the first handler in the chain. It does not need to know which handler will handle the request.

## Usage

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is commonly used in scenarios where:

- The system needs to decouple senders and receivers of a request.
- Multiple objects can handle a request, and the appropriate handler is not known at compile time.
- The system needs to support dynamic addition or removal of handlers at runtime.

## Considerations

- **Order of Handlers**: Care should be taken to ensure that the order of handlers in the chain is appropriate. Handlers should be arranged in a way that allows them to handle requests effectively without overlapping responsibilities.

- **Performance**: Depending on the size and complexity of the chain, the Chain of Responsibility pattern may introduce a performance overhead due to the need to traverse the entire chain to handle a request. However, this overhead is usually minimal in most applications.

- **Maintenance**: The Chain of Responsibility pattern may require careful maintenance to ensure that handlers are added or removed correctly and that the chain remains effective in handling requests.

Overall, the Chain of Responsibility pattern is a useful tool for decoupling senders and receivers of a request and allowing multiple objects to handle the request dynamically at runtime. It promotes flexibility and extensibility by allowing handlers to be added or removed without modifying existing client code.
