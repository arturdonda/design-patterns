# Command (Behavioral)

The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. This pattern allows requests to be queued, logged, and stored for undoable operations. It decouples the sender and receiver of a request by encapsulating the request as an object.

## Intent

The intent of the Command pattern is to encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It enables the separation of the sender and receiver of a request and supports undoable operations.

## Structure

The Command pattern typically involves the following components:

1. **Command**: This interface declares a method for executing a command.

2. **Concrete Command**: Concrete Command classes implement the Command interface and encapsulate a specific action or request.

3. **Invoker**: The Invoker class is responsible for invoking commands. It holds a reference to the command object and calls its execute method when needed.

4. **Receiver**: The Receiver class knows how to perform the operations associated with a command. It is the target of the command and performs the actual work.

5. **Client**: The Client class creates and configures commands and their receivers. It then associates the commands with invokers and initiates command execution.

## Usage

The Command pattern is commonly used in scenarios where:

- Requests need to be queued, logged, or stored for undoable operations.
- The sender and receiver of a request need to be decoupled.
- The system needs to support the execution of commands based on dynamic conditions or configurations.

## Considerations

- **Undo and Redo Operations**: The Command pattern supports undo and redo operations by storing a history of commands. Care should be taken to implement these operations efficiently, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.

- **Command Queues**: The Command pattern facilitates the creation of command queues, allowing commands to be executed asynchronously or in a specific order.

- **Complexity**: Depending on the requirements, the Command pattern may introduce additional complexity, especially when managing command execution, history, and undo/redo operations.

Overall, the Command pattern is a powerful tool for encapsulating requests as objects and decoupling the sender and receiver of a request. It promotes flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability by allowing commands to be easily added, removed, and executed based on dynamic conditions or configurations.
